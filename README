```

### Parameters

- `<aws_region>`: The AWS region where the resources are located (e.g., `us-east-1`).

```

## Script Details

The script performs the following checks and actions:

1.   Argument Check: Validates that exactly two arguments (region and service) are provided.
2.   AWS CLI Installation Check  : Verifies if the AWS CLI is installed.
3.   AWS CLI Configuration Check  : Ensures the AWS CLI is properly configured.
4.   Service Listing  : Based on the specified service, it executes the corresponding AWS CLI command to list resources.

## Error Handling
